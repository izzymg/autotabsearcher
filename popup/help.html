        <ul>
            <li class="explain">"Tab to watch" lists all open tabs in your browser. Select the one you wish to monitor from this list. </li>
            <li class="explain">"Search term" is the text (case-sensitive) you wish to search the page for each reload. </li>
            <li class="explain"> Regex means "regular expressions", an advanced format to search for text. Learn more
                <a href="https://www.regexbuddy.com/regex.html"> here.</a> By default, regex support is turned off, because some characters will fail to search unless properly
                escaped, for example the period '.'
            </li>
            <li class="explain">"Reload interval" is the time in seconds waited after each reload of the page and search. It is recommended you
                use a value greater than 20 seconds. If the page loads slower than the reload interval, it may fail to search.
            </li>
            <li class="explain"> Finally, click "start" to begin monitoring the tab selected. You can monitor as many tabs as you like at once.
            </li>
            <li class="explainSm"> Sorry that this page looks bad. </li>
